## Step 1

Implement this design in React.js following the design specifications.

## Step 2

The address should be geocoded by sending a request. 
If the address is valid, the icon color should change (yellow for Pick Up and green for Drop Off) and a marker should be added on the map.

If the address is invalid, the icon color should be red.

## Step 3 & Step 4

Once we have two valid addresses, when the user clicks on the button a new request should be send. Once the request is done, the form should
be reseted and a toaster saying "Job has been created successfully!" should appear

## Let's try!

If you want to test if my project works, you should know that the API work with two addresses *29 Rue du 4 Septembre* and *15

Write them in the form and test ðŸš´ðŸ’«
